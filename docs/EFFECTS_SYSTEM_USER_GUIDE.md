6. Click Apply to make changes permanent

**Best For**:
- Creating glitch or distortion effects
- Adding visual noise for artistic effect
- Simulating signal interference or degradation
- Creating textured backgrounds from solid fills
- Generating organic randomness while maintaining structure

**Pattern Comparison**:
- **Noise**: Best for smooth, flowing distortions
- **Bayer 2√ó2**: Creates regular, grid-like patterns with predictable structure
- **Bayer 4√ó4**: More complex patterns with finer detail and variation
- **Gaussian**: Most natural-looking randomness, great for organic scatter

**Pro Tips**:
- **Use Same Seed**: Record your seed value to recreate exact scatter patterns
- **Low Strength**: Subtle scatter (10-30) creates realistic noise without destroying readability
- **High Strength**: Extreme scatter (70-100) for abstract or chaotic effects
- **Pattern Layering**: Apply scatter multiple times with different patterns for complex textures
- **Timeline Consistency**: Use same seed across frames for consistent animation scatter

## üí° **Tips & Best Practices**

### **General Usage**
- **Start Small**: Make subtle adjustments first, then increase if needed
- **Use Live Preview**: Take advantage of real-time preview to see results instantly
- **Combine Effects**: Apply multiple effects in sequence for complex transformations
- **Save Frequently**: Apply effects you're happy with before experimenting further

### **Color Effects (Levels, Hue & Saturation)**
- **Levels First**: Apply Levels adjustments before Hue & Saturation for best results
- **Gamma Power**: Use Gamma for natural-looking brightness adjustments
- **Subtle Hue Shifts**: Small hue changes (¬±30¬∞) often look more natural
- **Saturation Balance**: Too much saturation can make colors appear artificial

### **Remap Effects (Colors, Characters)**
- **Analyze First**: Let auto-population show you what's actually in your canvas
- **Frequency Focus**: Start with the most-used colors/characters for biggest impact
- **Test Combinations**: Try different character combinations for varied artistic styles
- **Preserve Contrast**: When remapping colors, maintain good contrast for readability

### **Timeline Effects**
- **Timeline Toggle**: Enable "Apply to entire timeline" for consistent effects across all frames
- **Preview Single Frame**: Leave toggle off to preview effect on current frame first
- **Performance**: Timeline effects take longer but ensure consistency across animation

## üöÄ **Advanced Workflows**

### **Color Scheme Creation**
1. Start with base artwork using placeholder colors
2. Use Remap Colors to systematically replace with final palette
3. Use Hue & Saturation for fine-tuning color mood
4. Apply Levels for final contrast adjustments

### **Style Transformation**
1. Create original artwork with basic characters
2. Use Remap Characters to experiment with different character sets
3. Try solid blocks for filled look, or line characters for outline style
4. Combine with color remapping for complete style transformation

### **Animation Consistency**
1. Enable "Apply to entire timeline" toggle
2. Apply effects to ensure consistency across all frames
3. Use Timeline preview to check smooth animation flow
4. Make frame-specific adjustments if needed

The Effects System is designed to enhance your creative workflow while maintaining the quality and precision that ASCII Motion is known for. Experiment with different combinations to discover unique artistic possibilities!
- **Lightness** (-100% to +100%): Controls brightness

- Enable "Preserve Spacing" to maintain layout
- Characters are limited to single characters only
- Great for converting between different ASCII character sets

## Live Preview System

The live preview system shows effect changes on your canvas in real-time without modifying your actual data.

**How it Works**:
1. **Auto-Start**: Preview automatically starts when you open an effect panel
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Changes update immediately as you adjust settings
3. **Non-Destructive**: Your original canvas data is never modified until you Apply
4. **Toggle Control**: Use the preview toggle button to turn preview on/off

**Preview Controls**:
- **Live Preview Toggle**: Blue section in each effect panel
- **On State**: Shows "Changes are shown on canvas" 
- **Off State**: Shows "Preview is disabled"
- **Eye Icon**: Indicates preview status

## Application Modes

### Single Frame Mode (Default)
- Effects apply only to the current canvas/frame
- Best for static ASCII art or individual frame editing
- Changes appear immediately

### Timeline Mode  
- Effects apply to all frames in your animation
- Toggle "Apply to entire timeline" at the bottom of effect panels
- Useful for consistent effects across animations
- Processing may take longer for complex animations

## Canvas Analysis

Each effect panel includes intelligent canvas analysis:

**Color Analysis** (Levels, Hue & Saturation, Remap Colors):
- Shows unique colors found in your canvas
- Displays usage frequency for each color
- Click colors to select them for remapping
- Provides statistics like fill percentage

**Character Analysis** (Remap Characters):  
- Shows unique characters found in your canvas
- Displays usage frequency for each character
- Click characters to select them for remapping
- Special display for spaces (shown as ‚ê£)

## History and Undo/Redo

The Effects system is fully integrated with ASCII Motion's history system:

- **Undo Support**: Use Ctrl+Z (Cmd+Z on Mac) to undo effect applications
- **Redo Support**: Use Ctrl+Y (Cmd+Y on Mac) to redo undone effects  
- **History Tracking**: Each effect application creates a history entry
- **State Preservation**: Canvas and animation state is fully preserved

## Performance Tips

- **Preview Performance**: Preview updates happen in real-time, so complex effects on large canvases may be slower
- **Timeline Effects**: Applying to entire timeline processes all frames - expect longer processing times
- **Canvas Size**: Larger canvases will take longer to process
- **Color/Character Count**: More unique colors/characters mean longer analysis times

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z**: Undo last effect application  
- **Ctrl+Y / Cmd+Y**: Redo undone effect
- **Escape**: Close current effect panel (cancels preview)

## Troubleshooting

**Preview not showing changes**:
- Check that Live Preview is enabled (blue toggle section)
- Verify your settings are actually different from defaults
- Try toggling preview off and on

**Effect not applying**:
- Ensure you have canvas data to apply effects to
- Check that you're not trying to apply to empty canvas
- Verify timeline mode is set correctly for your needs

**Performance issues**:
- Turn off preview for large canvases while adjusting settings
- Apply effects to individual frames instead of entire timeline
- Close other applications to free up system resources

## Best Practices

1. **Use Preview**: Always preview effects before applying
2. **Start Small**: Test effects on small sections first  
3. **Save Often**: Save your project before applying complex effects
4. **Experiment**: Try combining multiple effects for unique results
5. **Canvas Analysis**: Use the color/character picking features for precise control
6. **History**: Remember you can always undo - don't be afraid to experiment!

## Advanced Techniques

### Color Scheme Changes
1. Use Remap Colors to replace primary colors
2. Follow with Hue & Saturation for fine-tuning
3. Apply Levels for final contrast adjustments

### Character Style Conversion  
1. Identify common characters with Remap Characters analysis
2. Map to desired style (e.g., geometric to organic shapes)
3. Use Preserve Spacing to maintain layout

### Animation Effects
1. Set "Apply to entire timeline" for consistent effects
2. Preview on individual frames first
3. Consider performance impact on complex animations
