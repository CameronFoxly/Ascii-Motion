## How to Use

### Manual Cleanup (Run Anytime):
```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT cleanup_old_deleted_projects();
```

### Test Cleanup (Check What Would Be Deleted):
```sql
-- See projects that would be cleaned up
SELECT id, name, deleted_at, 
       EXTRACT(DAY FROM (NOW() - deleted_at)) AS days_deleted
FROM public.projects
WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL
  AND deleted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### View All Trash Items:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  deleted_at,
  deleted_at + INTERVAL '30 days' AS expires_at,
  EXTRACT(DAY FROM (NOW() - deleted_at)) AS days_deleted
FROM public.projects
WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY deleted_at DESC;
```

---

## Automated Scheduling (Optional)

### Option 1: Using pg_cron Extension

**Step 1: Enable Extension**
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;
```

**Step 2: Schedule Daily Cleanup**
```sql
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'cleanup-deleted-projects',
  '0 2 * * *', -- Run daily at 2 AM UTC
  $$SELECT cleanup_old_deleted_projects()$$
);
```

**Step 3: View Scheduled Jobs**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job;
```

**Step 4: Remove Schedule (if needed)**
```sql
SELECT cron.unschedule('cleanup-deleted-projects');
```

### Option 2: Using Supabase Edge Function

1. Create Edge Function that calls: `supabase.rpc('cleanup_old_deleted_projects')`
2. Schedule via cron-job.org, GitHub Actions, or similar
3. Configure to run daily at 2 AM UTC

### Option 3: Manual Execution

Run the function manually on a regular basis via Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT cleanup_old_deleted_projects();
```

---

## Verification Steps

### ✅ Function Deployed
```sql
SELECT routine_name, routine_type 
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name = 'cleanup_old_deleted_projects';
```
**Result:** Function exists ✅

### ✅ Migration Recorded
- Migration `20251014171449` in migrations list
- Version: `add_trash_cleanup_function`

### ✅ Permissions Set
- Authenticated users can execute function
- Function runs with SECURITY DEFINER (admin privileges)

---

## Next Steps

1. **✅ Function Deployed** - No action needed
2. **⏭️ Optional: Schedule Automation** - Choose scheduling method above
3. **⏭️ Monitor** - Check trash periodically or view Supabase logs
4. **⏭️ Test** - Wait 30+ days and verify cleanup works, or manually test with older data

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

To remove the cleanup function:
```sql
-- Remove function
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS cleanup_old_deleted_projects();

-- Revoke permissions (if needed before drop)
REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION cleanup_old_deleted_projects() FROM authenticated;
```

## Support

### Documentation:
- **Implementation Guide:** `/docs/TRASH_RESTORE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- **SQL Migration:** `/docs/SUPABASE_TRASH_CLEANUP_MIGRATION.sql`
- **This Deployment Log:** `/docs/TRASH_CLEANUP_DEPLOYMENT.md`

### Troubleshooting:
1. **Function not executing:** Check permissions with `SELECT * FROM information_schema.routine_privileges WHERE routine_name = 'cleanup_old_deleted_projects';`
2. **Items not deleting:** Verify date calculation with test query above
3. **Permission denied:** Ensure user has `EXECUTE` permission on function

---

## Success! 🎉

The trash cleanup system is now fully deployed and operational. Projects deleted more than 30 days ago will be permanently removed when the cleanup function runs.

**Deployment Status:** ✅ Complete  
**System Status:** 🟢 Operational  
**Next Cleanup:** Manual trigger or scheduled automation
