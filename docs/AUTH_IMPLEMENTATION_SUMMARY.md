## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Vite + React SPA (Unchanged)     │
│   ├─ Zustand stores                 │
│   ├─ Canvas rendering               │
│   ├─ Tool system                    │
│   └─ Export functionality           │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │
               ├──► Supabase (Backend)
               │    ├─ Auth (email/password + verification)
               │    ├─ PostgreSQL (projects, users, tiers)
               │    └─ Row Level Security (RLS)
               │
               └──► Vercel (Frontend Deployment - Unchanged)
```

**Key Decision:** ✅ **NO Next.js migration needed**
- Keep Vite for frontend (fast, optimized)
- Use Supabase client SDK for all backend operations
- Add serverless functions ONLY if needed later (Stripe webhooks)

---

## 📊 Database Schema Summary

### Tables Created

1. **`subscription_tiers`** - Tier definitions (free, pro, enterprise)
2. **`profiles`** - Extended user data (preferences, subscription info)
3. **`projects`** - Cloud-saved projects with canvas/animation data
4. **`project_versions`** - Version history (future premium feature)

### Security Features

- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- ✅ Users can only access their own data
- ✅ Database-level enforcement (not just client-side)
- ✅ GDPR-compliant account deletion function

### Helper Functions

- `get_user_tier()` - Fetch user's subscription tier
- `can_create_project()` - Check if user is within project limits
- `update_last_seen()` - Track user activity
- `delete_user_data()` - Complete GDPR-compliant data removal

---

## 🔄 User Flows

### Anonymous User Flow
```
1. Open ASCII Motion → Work locally (localStorage)
2. Create awesome animation
3. Click "Save to Cloud" → Prompted to sign up
4. Sign up → Verify email → Projects migrate automatically
5. Continue working with cloud sync
```

### Returning User Flow
```
1. Sign in → Fetch cloud projects
2. Load project into canvas
3. Edit → Auto-save every 30 seconds (if enabled)
4. Switch devices → Same project available
```

### Free Tier Limits
```
✅ Create unlimited local projects
✅ Save 3 projects to cloud
✅ All export formats available (PNG, MP4, SVG, etc.)
❌ Cannot save 4th project without upgrade prompt
```

## ✅ Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before starting development:

- [ ] Read AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md thoroughly
- [ ] Create Supabase account (free tier)
- [ ] Follow AUTH_QUICK_START.md setup steps
- [ ] Test Supabase connection locally
- [ ] Review legal documents and customize contact info
- [ ] Decide on priority: MVP features first or full implementation?

---

## 🚨 Critical Reminders

### DO ✅
- Keep Vite + React architecture (no Next.js migration)
- Use hybrid storage (localStorage + cloud)
- Implement email verification (reduces spam)
- Follow RLS patterns for data security
- Test account deletion flow thoroughly
- Update legal docs with your contact info

### DON'T ❌
- Don't migrate to Next.js (unnecessary complexity)
- Don't implement Stripe yet (validate demand first)
- Don't skip email verification (security risk)
- Don't commit .env.local to Git (secrets exposure)
- Don't bypass RLS policies (security vulnerability)

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Review this summary** and ask any questions
2. **Follow AUTH_QUICK_START.md** to set up Supabase (30 minutes)
3. **Start implementation:**
   - Option A: Full authentication system first
   - Option B: MVP (signup → save → load only)
4. **Test thoroughly** before deploying to production
5. **Update documentation** after implementation complete

---

## 🤔 Questions to Answer Before Starting

1. **MVP vs Full Implementation?**
   - MVP: Signup, signin, save/load projects only
   - Full: All features including auto-save, project management UI

2. **Email Branding?**
   - Use default Supabase templates, or customize now?

3. **Legal Documents?**
   - Review TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md and PRIVACY_POLICY.md
   - Add your contact email/address before deploying

4. **Testing Strategy?**
   - Manual testing only, or add automated tests?

## 📈 Success Metrics (Post-Launch)

Track these to determine if/when to add paid features:

- User signups per week
- Projects saved to cloud
- Active users (7-day, 30-day)
- Average projects per user
- Feature requests for premium features
- User retention rate

**Threshold for Payment:** ~100 active users requesting more storage
