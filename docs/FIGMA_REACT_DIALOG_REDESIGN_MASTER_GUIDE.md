# Figma ‚Üî React Dialog Redesign - Master Guide

> **Complete workflow for iterating on dialog designs using Figma and syncing back to React code**

---

## üìñ Overview

This master guide provides everything you need to redesign your ASCII Motion dialogs using Figma, then sync improvements back to your React codebase using Figma MCP tools.

**What you'll achieve:**
- Visual iteration on dialog designs without touching code
- Consistent design system across all dialogs
- Better spacing, layout, and visual hierarchy
- Streamlined design-to-code workflow

**Time Investment:**
- Initial setup: 2-3 hours (one time)
- Per dialog: 35-70 minutes

---

## üéØ The Problem & Solution

### The Problem

You can't directly export React components ‚Üí Figma designs. The workflow is one-way:
- ‚ùå React ‚Üí Figma (not possible with MCP)
- ‚úÖ Figma ‚Üí React (possible with MCP)

### The Solution

A three-phase workflow:
1. **Manual Recreation** - Recreate current dialogs in Figma based on code analysis
2. **Visual Iteration** - Experiment with designs in Figma
3. **Code Sync** - Use Figma MCP to generate code and extract improvements

## üé® Design Iteration Tips

### Experiment Freely in Figma

**Try these variations:**

1. **Spacing Experiments**
   - Current: `space-y-4` (16px)
   - Try: `space-y-6` (24px)
   - Try: `space-y-3` (12px)
   - Compare side-by-side

2. **Layout Variations**
   - Single column vs. two-column forms
   - Different button arrangements
   - Card-based vs. flat layouts

3. **Typography Hierarchy**
   - Larger titles (20px vs. 18px)
   - Different font weights
   - Tighter or looser line heights

4. **Visual Depth**
   - Stronger shadows
   - More pronounced borders
   - Background color variations for sections

5. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Test at 375px width
   - Adjust padding for smaller screens
   - Stack elements vertically

### Create Variants

**For A/B testing:**

1. Duplicate dialog frame
2. Name: "DialogName - Variant A", "DialogName - Variant B"
3. Make changes
4. Compare side-by-side
5. Choose winner
6. Generate code for best version

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with 1-2 simple dialogs
   - Learn the workflow
   - Then tackle complex ones

2. **Test Both Themes**
   - Always design in light AND dark
   - Verify colors work in both
   - Test before implementing

3. **Use Components**
   - Build reusable Figma components
   - Match React component structure
   - Maintain consistency

4. **Document Changes**
   - Note why you made changes
   - Keep design decisions recorded
   - Helps with future updates

5. **Iterate Incrementally**
   - Small improvements over time
   - Test each change
   - Don't redesign everything at once

6. **Focus on Layout**
   - Extract spacing/class improvements
   - Don't change business logic
   - Keep functionality intact

---

### Don'ts ‚ùå

1. **Don't Copy-Paste Generated Code**
   - Use as reference only
   - Extract patterns, not everything
   - Keep your existing logic

2. **Don't Skip Testing**
   - Always test in browser
   - Check responsive behavior
   - Verify dark mode works

3. **Don't Over-Design**
   - Match existing shadcn/ui patterns
   - Don't deviate too far from system
   - Consistency > uniqueness

4. **Don't Rush**
   - Take time to understand patterns
   - Learn from each dialog
   - Quality > quantity

5. **Don't Forget Mobile**
   - Always test at mobile sizes
   - Dialogs should work on 375px screens
   - Responsive is not optional
