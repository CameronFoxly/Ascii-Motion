# Trash & Restore Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete trash/restore system for cloud projects with automatic cleanup after 30 days, preventing database bloat while maintaining data recovery capabilities.

## Implementation Date
October 14, 2025

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Automated Database Cleanup** âœ…
**File:** `docs/SUPABASE_TRASH_CLEANUP_MIGRATION.sql`

- Created PostgreSQL function `cleanup_old_deleted_projects()`
- Automatically deletes projects that have been in trash > 30 days
- Prevents database bloat from accumulating soft-deleted records
- Includes scheduling options via pg_cron or Supabase Edge Functions

**SQL Function:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cleanup_old_deleted_projects()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM public.projects
  WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL
    AND deleted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**Deployment Instructions:**
1. Copy SQL from `docs/SUPABASE_TRASH_CLEANUP_MIGRATION.sql`
2. Run in Supabase SQL Editor
3. (Optional) Set up cron schedule for automatic daily cleanup

---

### 2. **Backend Functions** âœ…
**File:** `packages/premium/src/cloud/useCloudProject.ts`

#### New Functions:
- **`listDeletedProjects()`** - Fetches projects where `deleted_at IS NOT NULL`
- **`restoreProject(projectId)`** - Sets `deleted_at` back to `null`, restoring the project

#### Modified Functions:
- **`deleteProject()`** - Updated comment to clarify it moves to trash (soft delete)
- **`listProjects()`** - Updated comment to clarify it returns active projects only

**API Pattern:**
```typescript
// Restore a deleted project
const restoreProject = async (projectId: string) => {
  await fetch(`${supabaseUrl}/rest/v1/projects?id=eq.${projectId}`, {
    method: 'PATCH',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      deleted_at: null,
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    }),
  });
};
```

---

### 3. **UI Components** âœ…
**File:** `src/components/features/ProjectsDialog.tsx`

#### New UI Elements:
1. **Trash Section** - Collapsible section at bottom of projects list
2. **Trash Toggle Button** - Shows/hides deleted projects
3. **Trash Counter** - Displays count of deleted projects: "Trash (3)"
4. **Deleted Project Cards** - Read-only cards with limited controls
5. **Restore Button** - Primary action for deleted projects
6. **Warning Message** - "Items in trash removed permanently after 30 days"

#### State Management:
```typescript
const [deletedProjects, setDeletedProjects] = useState<CloudProject[]>([]);
const [trashExpanded, setTrashExpanded] = useState(false);
```

#### Visual Design:
- **Collapsed by default** - Keeps main view clean
- **Chevron icon** - Indicates expand/collapse state
- **Reduced opacity** (60%) - Visually distinguishes trash items
- **No edit controls** - Prevents editing items in trash
- **Restore button** - Prominent outline button with undo icon
- **Grey borders** - Consistent with overall dialog design

## User Flow

### Deleting a Project:
1. User clicks "Delete" in project dropdown menu
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. Project moves to trash (soft delete - `deleted_at` timestamp set)
4. Project removed from main list
5. Trash counter increments

### Viewing Trash:
1. User clicks "Trash (N)" button at bottom of dialog
2. Section expands to show deleted projects
3. Cards display with reduced opacity
4. Shows deletion date and 30-day warning

### Restoring a Project:
1. User clicks "Restore" button on deleted project card
2. `deleted_at` set to `null`
3. Project immediately returns to main active list
4. Trash counter decrements
5. Section auto-collapses if empty

### Automatic Cleanup:
1. Scheduled function runs daily (2 AM UTC recommended)
2. Permanently deletes projects where `deleted_at > 30 days ago`
3. Runs silently in background
4. No user action required

---

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes:
- âœ… No schema changes needed (`deleted_at` column already exists)
- âœ… Added cleanup function via SQL migration
- âœ… Optional cron job for automated cleanup

### API Changes:
**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /projects?deleted_at=not.is.null` - List deleted projects
- `PATCH /projects?id=eq.{id}` with `{deleted_at: null}` - Restore project

### Component Structure:
```
ProjectsDialog
â”œâ”€â”€ Active Projects Grid
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Project Cards (editable)
â””â”€â”€ Trash Section (collapsible)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Warning Message
    â””â”€â”€ Deleted Projects Grid
        â””â”€â”€ Project Cards (read-only, restore button)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Manual permanent delete** - "Empty Trash" button
2. **Individual permanent delete** - Option in trash card dropdown
3. **Days remaining indicator** - Show "23 days left" on trash cards

2. Measure average time between delete and restore
3. Identify projects that expire without restoration

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing:
- [ ] Delete a project â†’ Verify it moves to trash
- [ ] Expand trash â†’ Verify project appears with reduced opacity
- [ ] Restore project â†’ Verify it returns to active list
- [ ] Trash auto-collapses when empty
- [ ] Canvas preview renders correctly in trash
- [ ] "Last deleted" date displays correctly
- [ ] Trash counter updates accurately
- [ ] Multiple projects in trash display correctly
- [ ] Grid layout responsive (1/2/3 columns)

### Database Testing:
- [ ] Run `cleanup_old_deleted_projects()` manually
- [ ] Verify projects > 30 days deleted are removed
- [ ] Verify projects < 30 days remain in trash
- [ ] Check RLS policies allow restore for project owner
- [ ] Confirm `updated_at` updates on restore

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Database Function:
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy from docs/SUPABASE_TRASH_CLEANUP_MIGRATION.sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cleanup_old_deleted_projects()...
```

### 2. (Optional) Schedule Cleanup:
```sql
-- If using pg_cron
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'cleanup-deleted-projects',
  '0 2 * * *',
  $$SELECT cleanup_old_deleted_projects()$$
);
```

### 3. Deploy Application:
```bash
npm run build:packages
# Deploy to production
```

### 4. Monitor:
- Check Supabase logs for cleanup execution
- Monitor database size trends
- Track restore/delete metrics

---

## Support & Documentation

### For Users:
- **Trash visible** - Look for "Trash (N)" at bottom of My Cloud Projects dialog
- **30-day retention** - Deleted projects automatically removed after 30 days
- **Restore anytime** - Click "Restore" button within 30-day window

### For Developers:
- **Cleanup function** - See `docs/SUPABASE_TRASH_CLEANUP_MIGRATION.sql`
- **Hook API** - `useCloudProject()` exports `restoreProject()` and `listDeletedProjects()`
- **UI Component** - Trash section in `ProjectsDialog.tsx` lines 463+

---

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators:
1. **Restore rate** - % of deleted projects that get restored
2. **Database size** - Should stabilize after cleanup implementation
3. **User satisfaction** - Reduced complaints about accidental deletions
4. **Support tickets** - Fewer "can you recover my deleted project" requests

### Expected Outcomes:
- ðŸ“‰ Database growth rate decreases
- ðŸ“ˆ User confidence increases (safety net in place)
- âš¡ Query performance maintains or improves
- ðŸŽ¯ Storage costs remain predictable

- **User-friendly** - Familiar trash paradigm (like Gmail, Dropbox)
- **Safe** - 30-day recovery window
- **Efficient** - Automatic cleanup prevents bloat
