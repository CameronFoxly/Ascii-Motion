## Phase 1.5: Architecture Refactoring Plan 🏗️

**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Major refactoring to improve maintainability
**Issue**: `CanvasGrid.tsx` had grown to 500+ lines and handled too many responsibilities
**Goal**: Improve maintainability, performance, and testability before adding animation features

### 🏗️ **Architectural Decisions Made**

#### **Context + Hooks Pattern for Canvas System**
We've established a new pattern for managing complex component state:

**Before (Anti-pattern)**: 
- Single 500+ line component with multiple `useState` calls
- Mixed concerns (rendering, interaction, state management)
- Hard to test and maintain

**After (New Pattern)**:
- `CanvasContext` for component-specific state
- `useCanvasState` hook for computed values and helpers
- Focused components with single responsibilities

**Key Files Created:**
- `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx` - Canvas state provider
- `src/hooks/useCanvasState.ts` - Canvas state management hook
- Updated `src/components/organisms/CanvasGrid.tsx` - Now uses context

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Reduced CanvasGrid from 501 to 424 lines (-15%)
- ✅ Better separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier to test individual pieces
- ✅ Pattern can be reused for other complex components

#### **Future Pattern Guidelines**
When any component exceeds ~200 lines or has multiple concerns:
1. **Extract state to Context** if state is component-specific
2. **Create custom hooks** for complex logic
3. **Split rendering** from interaction handling
4. **Create tool-specific** components when applicable

**Critical Zustand Hook Pattern**:
When creating hooks that use Zustand store data in useCallback/useMemo/useEffect:
- ✅ **Include all reactive store data** in dependency arrays
- ✅ **Destructure store data** at hook level, not inside callbacks
- ❌ **Don't rely on getters alone** - include the actual data objects
- 📝 **Example**: If using `getCell()`, also include `cells` in dependencies

This ensures consistent architecture across all development sessions.

### 🔄 **For Future Development Sessions**

**IMPORTANT**: When continuing this refactoring or adding new features:

1. **Always check COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md** for current architectural patterns
2. **Follow the Context + Hooks pattern** for complex component state
3. **Reference completed steps** in this document to understand the current structure
4. **Before modifying CanvasGrid**: Check if logic belongs in hooks or separate components
5. **When adding new tools**: Create separate tool components in `src/components/tools/`

**Current Architecture Status** (Updated Sept 3, 2025):
- ✅ Canvas state management extracted to Context (Step 1)
- ✅ Mouse interaction logic extracted to Hooks (Step 2) - COMPLETE 
- ✅ Rendering split (Step 3) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Tool-specific components (Step 4) - COMPLETE

**Step 2 Completion Summary**:
- CanvasGrid reduced from 501 lines → 245 lines (~51% reduction)
- Created 5 specialized mouse handling hooks
- All functionality preserved: selection, drawing, rectangles, move operations
- Mouse drag events working correctly for all tools

**Pattern Example for New Features**:
```tsx
// ✅ DO: Use established patterns
function NewCanvasFeature() {
  const { canvasRef } = useCanvasContext();
  const { statusMessage } = useCanvasState();
  // ...
}

// ❌ DON'T: Add more useState to CanvasGrid
function CanvasGrid() {
  const [newState, setNewState] = useState(); // NO!
  // ...
}
```

### 🎯 Refactoring Overview

The `CanvasGrid` component has become a "god component" that handles:
- Canvas rendering (drawing cells, grid, selection overlays)
- Mouse interaction (drawing, selection, drag & drop)
- Complex selection state management 
- Move/drag state with real-time preview
- Keyboard event handling
- Multiple drawing tool behaviors

**Target**: Break into focused, composable components and hooks

### 📋 Refactoring Tasks

#### **Step 1: Extract Canvas Context & State Management** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx` - Canvas-specific state provider
  - Canvas dimensions, cell size, zoom level
  - Local rendering state (separate from global canvas store)
  - Canvas interaction modes and flags
- [x] `src/hooks/useCanvasState.ts` - Canvas state management hook
- [x] Move local state out of `CanvasGrid` into context
- [x] Update `App.tsx` to wrap CanvasGrid with CanvasProvider

**Completed**: 
- ✅ Created `CanvasContext` with canvas-specific state (cellSize, interaction flags, selection/move state)
- ✅ Created `useCanvasState` hook with computed values and helper functions
- ✅ Created `useCanvasDimensions` helper for coordinate calculations
- ✅ Refactored `CanvasGrid` to use context instead of local useState
- ✅ All functionality preserved, ~50 lines removed from CanvasGrid component
- ✅ No breaking changes - all existing features work correctly

#### **Step 2: Extract Mouse Interaction Logic** ✅
- ✅ `src/hooks/useCanvasMouseHandlers.ts` - Core mouse event handling
  - Mouse coordinate conversion
  - Basic click/drag detection
  - Tool-agnostic mouse state
- ✅ `src/hooks/useCanvasSelection.ts` - Selection-specific logic
  - Selection bounds calculation
  - Selection rendering helpers
  - Selection state management
- ✅ `src/hooks/useCanvasDragAndDrop.ts` - Drag & drop behavior
  - Move state management
  - Drag preview rendering
  - Drop commit logic

**Results**: 
- ✅ Refactored `CanvasGrid` from 501 lines down to 245 lines (~256 lines removed)
- ✅ All mouse handling logic extracted to specialized hooks
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate mouse handler declarations
- ✅ Preserved all existing functionality including selection, drawing, and tool switching
- ✅ No breaking changes - development server runs successfully

#### **Step 3: Split Rendering Responsibilities** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Goal**: Extract rendering logic from CanvasGrid.tsx while preserving all integration with the hook ecosystem.

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created `src/hooks/useCanvasRenderer.ts` - Coordinated rendering hook (159 lines)
- ✅ Extracted `drawCell` function and main rendering logic from CanvasGrid
- ✅ Combined grid rendering and selection overlay rendering in correct order
- ✅ Reduced CanvasGrid from 246 lines → 109 lines (~56% reduction)
- ✅ Preserved all visual features: selection marquee, move preview, grid rendering
- ✅ Maintained canvas resize handling and re-render coordination
- ✅ Fixed live rendering bug: Added `cells` dependency to ensure real-time updates
- ✅ No breaking changes - all functionality working correctly

**Critical Bug Fix During Step 3**:
- **Issue**: Drawing tools (pencil, eraser, fill) were not updating canvas in real-time
- **Root Cause**: `useCanvasRenderer` hook missing `cells` dependency in useCallback
- **Solution**: Added `cells` from `useCanvasStore()` to dependency array
- **Lesson**: When extracting Zustand store logic to hooks, ensure all reactive data is in dependencies

**Architecture Decision**: 
- **Pattern**: Used hook-based rendering instead of separate components
- **Reason**: Maintains rendering order (grid first, then overlays) and avoids component lifecycle coordination issues
- **Benefits**: Cleaner separation, easier to test, single hook manages all canvas rendering concerns

**Before/After**:
- CanvasGrid.tsx: 246 lines → 109 lines (137 lines removed)
- New hook: useCanvasRenderer.ts (159 lines of extracted rendering logic)
- Net result: ~20 lines reduction + much better separation of concerns

#### **Step 4: Create Tool-Specific Components** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Goal**: Extract tool-specific logic into focused, reusable components for better maintainability and easier tool development.

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created `src/components/tools/` directory with tool-specific components:
  - `SelectionTool.tsx` (53 lines) - Selection tool behavior and status UI
  - `DrawingTool.tsx` (42 lines) - Pencil/eraser tool logic and status
  - `PaintBucketTool.tsx` (30 lines) - Fill tool implementation and status
  - `RectangleTool.tsx` (30 lines) - Rectangle drawing logic and status
  - `EyedropperTool.tsx` (26 lines) - Color/character picking and status
- ✅ Created `src/hooks/useToolBehavior.ts` (109 lines) - Tool behavior coordination and metadata
- ✅ Created `src/components/organisms/ToolManager.tsx` (34 lines) - Renders active tool component
- ✅ Created `src/components/organisms/ToolStatusManager.tsx` (34 lines) - Renders tool status UI
- ✅ Updated CanvasGrid to use ToolManager and ToolStatusManager
- ✅ Improved cursor logic using tool-specific cursor styles
- ✅ Maintained final CanvasGrid size at 111 lines (minimal growth due to new imports)

**Architecture Achievement**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each tool now has its own focused component
- **Status UI Enhancement**: Rich, tool-specific status messages replace generic statusMessage
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools by creating new tool components
- **Maintainability**: Tool logic isolated and independently testable
- **Composition Pattern**: CanvasGrid now composes tool components rather than handling tool logic directly

**Total New Files Created**: 8 files, 358 lines of well-organized tool-specific code
**Pattern Established**: Clear template for future tool development

#### **Step 5: Performance Optimizations**
- [ ] Canvas viewport/chunking for large grids (200x100+ support)
- [ ] Implement dirty region tracking for partial re-renders
- [ ] Memoize cell rendering with `React.memo`
- [ ] Debounce canvas updates during active drawing
- [ ] Optimize selection rendering performance

#### **Step 6: Final Canvas Composition**
- [ ] Refactor `CanvasGrid.tsx` to be a composition component:
```tsx
// Target structure:
<CanvasProvider>
  <CanvasRenderer />
  <CanvasOverlay />
  <CanvasInteraction>
    {activeTool === 'select' && <SelectionTool />}
    {activeTool === 'pencil' && <DrawingTool />}
    {activeTool === 'paintbucket' && <PaintBucketTool />}
    {/* Other tool components */}
  </CanvasInteraction>
</CanvasProvider>
```

### 🎯 Success Criteria

**Maintainability**:
- [ ] No component > 200 lines
- [ ] Each component has single responsibility
- [ ] Easy to add new tools without modifying existing code
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests possible

**Performance**:

2. **Feature Parity**: Ensure all current functionality works after each step
3. **Testing**: Add tests as we extract components
4. **Documentation**: Update this plan as we complete tasks

### 📅 Timeline Estimate

- **Step 1-2**: ✅ COMPLETE (2 sessions - context + mouse handlers)
- **Step 3**: 1-2 sessions (rendering split) - **NEXT**
- **Step 4**: 2-3 sessions (tool components)
- **Step 5**: 1-2 sessions (performance)
- **Step 6**: 1 session (final composition)

**Total**: ~6-10 development sessions

## 🎯 **STEP 3 PREPARATION - Session Handover Notes**

### **Current Files Ready for Extraction**
**File**: `src/components/organisms/CanvasGrid.tsx` (245 lines)

**Key Functions to Extract**:
1. **`drawCell`** (lines 57-85): Character rendering logic
2. **`renderGrid`** (lines 87-175): Main canvas drawing + selection overlay
3. **Canvas resize useEffect** (lines ~180-190): Canvas dimension handling

### **Step 3 Success Criteria**
- [ ] CanvasGrid.tsx reduced to ~100-120 lines (pure composition)
- [ ] Rendering logic in separate focused components
- [ ] All visual features preserved (selection marquee, move preview, etc.)
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved

### **Dependencies to Preserve**
- Canvas context integration (`useCanvasContext`)
- Selection state rendering (`selection.active`, move state preview)  
- Tool-specific rendering (selection marquee, move ghosts)
- Grid line rendering and cell backgrounds

### **Testing Requirements**
- Selection tool: Create, move, and clear selections
- Rectangle tool: Draw rectangles with preview
- Drawing tools: Pencil/eraser functionality
